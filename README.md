# Meet Kanso.css

A classless CSS template for simple forms and web pages.

In Japanese, Kanso translates to simplicity or purity, advocating for the elimination of the unnecessary. I wanted a template that reflected this philosophy, offering a clean, minimal, and distraction-free experience that can be added onto.

## Features

Sticking to its core principles, Kanso.css minimizes its number of declarations, whilst being responsive and easily customizable.

At less than 100 lines, Kanso.css is a tiny 1.3 KB in size.

Works as a standalone classless CSS framework, but can be added onto and tailored for specific projects.

Font and colors are stored as global variables, making it easy to theme Kanso.css.

Comes with a dark theme by default.
